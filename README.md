Project Model Abstractions
--------------------------

Declarative abstractions around .NET project model systems. Provides API designed for design-time tools that need to understand the user's project.

Current implementations:

 - Microsoft.DotNet.ProjectModle (aka 'project.json', the project model in .NET Core SDK preview 2)
 - MSBuild
